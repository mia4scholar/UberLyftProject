CSE 217 - Introduction to Data Science HW6
" For our midterm project this semester, we'll take a look at data for numerous Lyft and Uber rides in Boston and their prices (https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma). 
Our goal will be to use this dataset to gain some insight about characteristics of rides and _perhaps_ find some patterns in this data.
In general, we will be following the EDA process:

1. Get the data and gain basic understanding
2. Wrangle the data
3. Profile the data
4. Develop questions to investigate (form a hypotheses)
5. Use the data to investigate hypothesis
6. Summarize results and answer questions
7. Critically review our workflow and discuss ethical concerns "
